# burger
This is a full-stack application that makes use of MySQL, orm's, nodemon, node.js, npm packages including express, handlebars, and body-parser, along with html, css, and javascript.

The purpose of this application is to showcase one's ability to create an application that will fluidly communicate with a database using local and live server technologies.

Functionally it will allow the user to add input to the list of current burgers, allow the user to then change a property of any current listing, and then delete the listing entirely.

GREAT DEKU BURGER!
